You are an expert biologist tasked with analyzing a system of interacting proteins and identifying the most prominent biological process they perform. Your analysis should be based on prior knowledge available in your training data.

Your task is to provide a critical analysis of the biological processes performed by this system of interacting proteins. Follow these steps:

1. Carefully analyze the functions and interactions of the proteins in the given system.
2. Identify the most prominent biological process performed by the system.
3. Propose a brief and detailed name for this process.
4. Assign a confidence score to the process name you've selected.

Put your chosen name at the top of the analysis as 'Process: <name>â€™.

Guidelines for your analysis:
- Be concise and avoid unnecessary words.
- Be factual and avoid editorializing.
- Be specific and avoid overly general statements such as 'the proteins are involved in various cellular processes'.
- Group proteins with similar functions and discuss their interplay, synergistic or antagonistic effects, and functional integration within the system.
- Avoid listing facts about individual proteins.
- Avoid choosing generic process names such as 'Cellular Signaling and Regulation'.

Confidence Score:
- The score should range from 0.00 to 1.00, where 0.00 indicates the lowest confidence and 1.00 reflects the highest confidence.
- Consider the proportion of genes in the protein system that participate in the identified biological process when determining your score.
- If you cannot identify a prominent biological process for the proteins in the system, name the process "System of unrelated proteins" and provide a score of 0.00.

Before providing your final output, wrap your thought process in <protein_analysis> tags. Consider the following:
- List each protein and its known function
- Group proteins with similar functions
- Identify potential interactions between these groups
- Consider the overall biological context
- List potential biological processes
- Rank these processes based on prominence and protein involvement
- The proportion of proteins involved in the identified process
- Any potential alternative processes that could be considered

Your final output should be structured as follows:
1. Process name and confidence score in sentence "Process: "
2. Detailed critical analysis follows

<Example>
The example system of interacting proteins is:
PDX1, SLC2A2, NKX6-1, GLP1, GCG.

The example analysis output is:

1. PDX1 is a homeodomain transcription factor involved in the specification of the early pancreatic epithelium and its subsequent differentiation. 
It activates the transcription of several genes including insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase and glucose transporter type 2. 
It is essential for maintenance of the normal hormone-producing phenotype in the pancreatic beta-cell. 
In pancreatic acinar cells, forms a complex with PBX1b and MEIS2b and mediates the activation of the ELA1 enhancer.

2. NKX6-1 is also a transcription factor involved in the development of pancreatic beta-cells during the secondary transition. 
Together with NKX2-2 and IRX3, controls the generation of motor neurons in the neural tube and belongs to the neural progenitor 
factors induced by Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signals.

3.GCG and GLP1, respectively glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1, are involved in glucose metabolism and homeostasis. 
GCG raises blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and is the counter regulatory hormone of Insulin. 
GLP1 is a potent stimulator of Glucose-Induced Insulin Secretion (GSIS). Plays roles in gastric motility and suppresses blood glucagon levels. 
Promotes growth of the intestinal epithelium and pancreatic islet mass both by islet neogenesis and islet cell proliferation.

4. SLC2A2, also known as GLUT2, is a facilitative hexose transporter. In hepatocytes, it mediates bi-directional transport of glucose accross the plasma membranes, 
while in the pancreatic beta-cell, it is the main transporter responsible for glucose uptake and part of the cell's glucose-sensing mechanism. 
It is involved in glucose transport in the small intestine and kidney too.

To summarize, the genes in this set are involved in the specification, differentiation, growth and functionality of the pancreas, 
with a particular emphasis on the pancreatic beta-cell. Particularly, the architecture of the pancreatic islet ensures proper glucose sensing 
and homeostasis via a number of different hormones and receptors that can elicit both synergistic and antagonistic effects in the pancreas itself and other peripheral tissues.
